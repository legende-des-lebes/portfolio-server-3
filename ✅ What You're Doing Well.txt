✅ What You're Doing Well
Category	Assessment
💡 Idea & Intent	Creating a dynamic, logging-enabled personal portfolio is smart. You're treating your site like a product, which is great.
🔧 Tech Stack	Express.js backend, Google Sheets API integration, IP geolocation — solid, real-world stack.
⚙️ Deployment	Using Render shows you're applying DevOps skills, not just local dev.
🛠️ Debugging	You pushed through some tough issues (OpenSSL, JSON, auth). That resilience is very important.
📈 Logging	Custom visitor tracking = awareness of analytics, which many skip entirely.

⚠️ Areas to Improve (For an IIT Portfolio)
Area	Suggestions
UI/UX / Frontend Polish	If the frontend is still basic or static (just HTML), consider upgrading to React, Next.js, or adding dynamic content. IIT portfolios are often interactive.
Security	Logging raw IPs and emails is fine for testing, but make sure you note that it's not storing sensitive info long-term or securely encrypted.
Database Integration	Using Google Sheets is cool, but showcasing a proper database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) would show stronger backend maturity.
Authentication	If you’re logging users, even fake auth (JWT, Google login, or OTP) could elevate the project to a full-stack experience.
Projects/Visuals	A great IIT portfolio often visually highlights internships, research, hackathon wins, etc. If that’s missing visually, add it.

🔥 How to Make It a 9.5+
Here’s how to take it from “nice student project” to “damn, this is product-level”:

✅ Frontend: Use React/Next.js + Tailwind for a beautiful interactive portfolio.

✅ Show dynamic sections:

Live activity tracker

Project cards with GitHub/Live links

Auto-generated resume/download

✅ Add roles: professor/student/dev — show/hide different content accordingly

✅ Include this Google Sheets logging as a “hidden analytics” or dashboard page

✅ Add graphs from the Sheet logs using chart.js or recharts

✅ Optional: Add a custom domain (e.g., vishnu.dev) for top-tier impression
